{"name":"Rootfit","tagline":"ROOTFIT","body":"# ROOTFIT\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT-FIT is descriptive model of fitted growth functions to root system architecture dynamics. ROOT-FIT was developed by Magdalena Julkowska and Christa Testerink. The R version was made by Guillaume Lobet and Magdalena Julkowska.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running ROOT-FIT\r\n\r\nTo launch ROOT-FIT, you need to have R installed on your computer. This is the only prerequisite.\r\n\r\nTo run ROOT-FIT: use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tlibrary(shiny)\r\n\tshiny::runGitHub(\"guillaumelobet/rootfit\", \"guillaumelobet\") \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nPS: an internet connection is needed, as the most recent version of ROOT-FIT will be download from the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using ROOT-FIT\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/rootfit/master/www/rootfit_ui.png)\r\n\r\n1. Load your .csv datafile\r\n2. Choose the fitting type\r\n3. Set the analysis options (these will be updated when the cvs file is loaded)\r\n\t- Time of treatment: day 0 of your experiment (by default the smallest day value in the datafile)\r\n\t- Reference genotype: used for the computation of the relative growth factors\r\n\t- Reference treatment: used for the computation of the relative growth factors\r\n\t- Find best fit on # samples: number of samples to used to find the best fitting function\r\n4. Choose the genotypes to plot (these will be updated when the cvs file is loaded)\r\n5. Unleash ROOT-FIT\t\r\n6. Inspect your data and download the plots\r\n7. Download the results\r\n\r\n## Data structure \r\n\r\nThe input datafile for ROOT-FIT  needs to be in a cvs form, with the following columns:\r\n\r\n\tPlate.name | Media | Genotype | Plant.id | Age | MR.path.length | Number.LR.MR | Total.root.size\r\n\t\r\n- **Plate.name** : the name of the image\r\n- **Media** : the media type, or treatment\r\n- **Genotype** : the genotype\r\n- **Plant.id** : the identifier of the plant (needs to be unique by image / genotype / treatment)\r\n- **Age** : age of the plant, in days\r\n- **MR.path.length** : the length of the primary root\r\n- **Number.LR.MR** : the number of lateral roots\r\n- **Total.root.size** : the total root system size (primary + laterals)\r\n\r\n## ROOT-FIT and RSML\r\n\r\nROOT-FIT is working with [rsml files](http://rootsystemml.github.io/), given a small pre-processing step:\r\n\r\n1. Install the ImageJ plugin [RSML_Reader_2.jar](https://github.com/RootSystemML/RSML-conversion-tools/blob/master/imagej/bin/RSML_reader_v2.jar)\r\n2. Launch the plugin in ImageJ\r\n3. Choose the folder containing all the RSML files\r\n4. Select the ROOT-FIT export option\r\n5. Run the Export\r\n6. Save the datafile and convert it to .csv format\r\n\r\nThe RSML_Reader_2 need the rms. files to be named as follow: \r\n\tEXPxx_GENxx_TRxx_BOXxx_DASxx\r\nwith:\r\n- EXPxx: replace xx by the experiment name\r\n- GENxx: replace xx by the genotype name\r\n- TRxx: replace xx by the treatment name\r\n- BOXxx: replace xx by the box number\r\n- DASxx: replace xx by the age of the plant (in day)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
